            What is coffee?
        </h2>

            <p>
                Coffee is a common drink that is obtained from roasted and ground coffee beans. Coffee is slightly
                acidic and because of its high caffeine content, it is a stimulant. This drink is the most popular hot
                drink in the world.

                The coffee plant is native to Yemen and Africa, but much more than these areas, it is cultivated in the
                subtropical and tropical regions of the American continent and Southeast Asia. It is also relatively
                less cultivated in some areas of South Asia such as India. When the fruit of the coffee plant ripens,
                the coffee beans are harvested and processed. they do. Dried coffee beans are roasted to different
                degrees, depending on the desired aroma and taste, different degrees of baking are considered for this
                product.
